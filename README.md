HOW IT WILL HELP ?

This is an application which prevents the domestic WiFI from man in the middle (MITM) attacks.
Whenever a hacker tries to connect to the domestic WiFi ,
The super user (or the already connected user) gets a notification from this application. 
If you find the newly entering user anonymous or not genuine you can deny the connection and block that user.
If you find the user genuine or trustworthy you can accept the user. 
This gives a total security to the domestic WiFi.
